# Language Specification of LEXOR Programming Language

## Introduction

LEXOR is a strongly – typed programming language developed to teach Senior High School students the basics of programming. It was developed by a group of students enrolled in the Programming Languages course. LEXOR is a pure interpreter.

### Sample Program

```lexor
%% this is a sample program in LEXOR
SCRIPT AREA
START SCRIPT
    DECLARE INT x, y, z=5
    DECLARE CHAR a_1='n'
    DECLARE BOOL t="TRUE"
    x=y=4
    a_1='c'
    %% this is a comment
    PRINT: x & t & z & $ & a_1 & [#] & "last"
END SCRIPT
```

**Output of the sample program:**
```
4TRUE5
c#last
```

## Language Grammar

### Program Structure

- all codes starts with SCRIPT AREA
- all codes are placed inside START SCRIPT and END SCRIPT
- all variable declaration follow right after the START SCRIPT keyword. It cannot be placed anywhere.
- all variable names are case sensitive and starts with letter or an underscore (_) and followed by a letter, underscore or digits.
- every line contains a single statement
- comments starts with double percent sign (%%) and it can be placed anywhere in the program
- executable codes are placed after variable declaration
- all reserved words are in capital letters and cannot be used as variable names
- dollar sign($) signifies next line or carriage return
- ampersand(&) serves as a concatenator
- the square braces([]) are as escape code

### Data Types

1. **INT** – an ordinary number with no decimal part. It occupies 4 bytes in the memory.
2. **CHAR** – a single symbol.
3. **BOOL** – represents the literals true or false.
4. **FLOAT** – a number with decimal part. It occupies 4 bytes in the memory.

### Operators

**Arithmetic operators**
- `( )` - parenthesis
- `*, /, %` - multiplication, division, modulo
- `+, -` - addition, subtraction
- `>, <` - greater than, lesser than
- `>=, <=` - greater than or equal to, lesser than or equal to
- `==, <>` - equal, not equal

**Logical operators** (`<BOOL expression><LogicalOperator><BOOL expression>`)
- **AND** - needs the two BOOL expression to be true to result to true, else false
- **OR** - if one of the BOOL expressions evaluates to true, returns true, else false
- **NOT** - the reverse value of the BOOL value

**Unary operator**
- `+` - positive
- `-` - negative

## Sample Programs

1. **A program with arithmetic operation**

```lexor
SCRIPT AREA
START SCRIPT
    DECLARE INT xyz, abc=100
    xyz= ((abc *5)/10 + 10) * -1
    PRINT: [[] & xyz & []]
END SCRIPT
```

**Output of the sample program:**
```
[-60]
```

2. **A program with logical operation**

```lexor
SCRIPT AREA
START SCRIPT
    DECLARE INT a=100, b=200, c=300
    DECLARE BOOL d="FALSE"
    d = (a < b AND c <>200)
    PRINT: d
END SCRIPT
```

**Output of the sample program:**
```
TRUE
```

### Output statement
**PRINT** - writes formatted output to the output device

### Input statement
**SCAN** – allow the user to input a value to a data type.

**Syntax:**
`SCAN: <variableName>[,<variableName>]*`

**Sample use:**
`SCAN: x, y`
It means in the screen you have to input two values separated by comma(,)

### Control flow structures

1. **Conditional**

    a. **if selection**
    ```lexor
    IF (<BOOL expression>)
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ```

    b. **if-else selection**
    ```lexor
    IF (<BOOL expression>)
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ELSE
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ```

    c. **if-else with multiple alternatives**
    ```lexor
    IF (<BOOL expression>)
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ELSE IF (<BOOL expression>)
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ELSE
    START IF
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END IF
    ```

2. **Loop Control Flow Structures**

    a. **FOR (initialization, condition, update)**
    ```lexor
    START FOR
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END FOR
    ```

    b. **REPEAT WHEN (<BOOL expression>)**
    ```lexor
    START REPEAT
        <statement>
        ...
        <statement>
    END REPEAT
    ```
